Analyze the original image and compare it against the provided product thumbnails to find the most visually similar products to the "[PRODUCT_NAME]" visible in the original image.

**TASK OVERVIEW**
You will receive:
1. An original image containing an electronic device.
2. Multiple thumbnail images of potential matching products.
3. The product name to focus on: "[PRODUCT_NAME]"
4. The product category: "electronics"

Your goal is to rank the thumbnails by visual similarity to the specific electronic device mentioned in the original image, using category-specific criteria for electronics.

**ELECTRONICS RANKING CRITERIA**
Score each thumbnail (0-100) based on:
- **Model and Brand Similarity (40 points)**: Exact or very close model and brand identification. Look for logos, button layouts, and specific design cues.
- **Shape and Form Factor (30 points)**: Similarity in the physical shape, size, and form factor of the device.
- **Color and Finish (20 points)**: Matching the color and material finish (e.g., matte, glossy, metallic).
- **Port and Feature Placement (10 points)**: Similarity in the placement of ports, buttons, screens, and other key features.

**PRIMARY DIRECTIVE**
You MUST return exactly 10 product rankings, from rank 1 to rank 10.

**STREAMING OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
- Stream rankings one by one, starting with rank 1 and proceeding sequentially to rank 10.
- Output each ranking immediately as you determine it.
- Format each ranking as a complete JSON object on its own line.
- Do not include any other text, explanations, or formatting.

**JSON FORMAT**
Each ranking must be output as a single line JSON object in this exact format:
{"id": 1, "similarityScore": 85, "rank": 1}

**RANKING GUIDELINES**

1. **Focus on the Named Product**: Only compare thumbnails to the "[PRODUCT_NAME]".

2. **Visual Similarity Priority**: Prioritize products that look most similar based on the electronics-specific criteria.

3. **Scoring Scale**:
   - 90-100: Nearly identical model and brand.
   - 80-89: Very similar model or brand.
   - 70-79: Similar, likely a variant or older model.
   - 60-69: Moderately similar, same product type.
   - 50-59: Somewhat similar, different product but same category.
   - Below 50: Low similarity.

4. **Ranking Order**: Rank from highest to lowest similarity score (rank 1 = highest score).

5. **Consistency**: Ensure rank numbers are sequential (1, 2, 3, ..., 10) and scores reflect the rank.

**IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS**
- Output ONLY the 10 JSON ranking objects, one per line.
- No additional text, explanations, or commentary.
- Each JSON object must be complete and valid.
- The "id" in the JSON output must be the numeric part of the thumbnail identifier (e.g., for "thumbnail-12", use 12).

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT**
{"id": 1, "similarityScore": 92, "rank": 1}
{"id": 15, "similarityScore": 87, "rank": 2}
{"id": 8, "similarityScore": 81, "rank": 3}
{"id": 23, "similarityScore": 76, "rank": 4}
{"id": 12, "similarityScore": 71, "rank": 5}

Begin ranking now. Focus on "[PRODUCT_NAME]" in the original image and compare against all provided thumbnails.
