Analyze the original image and compare it against the provided product thumbnails to find the most visually similar products to the "[PRODUCT_NAME]" visible in the original image.

**TASK OVERVIEW**
You will receive:
1. An original image containing a piece of furniture.
2. Multiple thumbnail images of potential matching products.
3. The product name to focus on: "[PRODUCT_NAME]"
4. The product category: "furniture"

Your goal is to rank the thumbnails by visual similarity to the specific piece of furniture mentioned in the original image, using category-specific criteria for furniture.

**FURNITURE RANKING CRITERIA**
Score each thumbnail (0-100) based on:
- **Style and Design (35 points)**: Similarity in design style (e.g., modern, traditional, industrial) and overall aesthetic.
- **Material and Finish (30 points)**: Visual similarity of materials (e.g., wood, metal, fabric) and finish (e.g., painted, stained, polished).
- **Shape and Proportions (25 points)**: Similarity in the overall shape, structure, and proportions of the furniture.
- **Color (10 points)**: Matching the primary and secondary colors.

**PRIMARY DIRECTIVE**
You MUST return exactly 10 product rankings, from rank 1 to rank 10.

**STREAMING OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
- Stream rankings one by one, starting with rank 1 and proceeding sequentially to rank 10.
- Output each ranking immediately as you determine it.
- Format each ranking as a complete JSON object on its own line.
- Do not include any other text, explanations, or formatting.

**JSON FORMAT**
Each ranking must be output as a single line JSON object in this exact format:
{"id": 1, "similarityScore": 85, "rank": 1}

**RANKING GUIDELINES**

1. **Focus on the Named Product**: Only compare thumbnails to the "[PRODUCT_NAME]".

2. **Visual Similarity Priority**: Prioritize products that look most similar based on the furniture-specific criteria.

3. **Scoring Scale**:
   - 90-100: Nearly identical design and material.
   - 80-89: Very similar style and form.
   - 70-79: Similar, likely a close match in style.
   - 60-69: Moderately similar, same type of furniture.
   - 50-59: Somewhat similar, different but related furniture.
   - Below 50: Low similarity.

4. **Ranking Order**: Rank from highest to lowest similarity score (rank 1 = highest score).

5. **Consistency**: Ensure rank numbers are sequential (1, 2, 3, ..., 10) and scores reflect the rank.

**IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS**
- Output ONLY the 10 JSON ranking objects, one per line.
- No additional text, explanations, or commentary.
- Each JSON object must be complete and valid.
- The "id" in the JSON output must be the numeric part of the thumbnail identifier (e.g., for "thumbnail-12", use 12).

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT**
{"id": 1, "similarityScore": 92, "rank": 1}
{"id": 15, "similarityScore": 87, "rank": 2}
{"id": 8, "similarityScore": 81, "rank": 3}
{"id": 23, "similarityScore": 76, "rank": 4}
{"id": 12, "similarityScore": 71, "rank": 5}

Begin ranking now. Focus on "[PRODUCT_NAME]" in the original image and compare against all provided thumbnails.
