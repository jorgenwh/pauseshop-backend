Analyze the original image and compare it against the provided product thumbnails to find the most visually similar products to the "[PRODUCT_NAME]" visible in the original image.

**TASK OVERVIEW**
You will receive:
1. An original image containing a product
2. Multiple thumbnail images of potential matching products
3. The product name to focus on: "[PRODUCT_NAME]"

Your goal is to rank the thumbnails by visual similarity to the specific product mentioned in the original image.

**RANKING CRITERIA**
Score each thumbnail (0-100) based on:
- **Visual Appearance Match (40 points)**: Overall shape, form, and visual characteristics
- **Color Similarity (25 points)**: Primary and secondary color matching
- **Shape/Form Similarity (20 points)**: Structural and dimensional similarity
- **Style/Design Similarity (15 points)**: Design elements, patterns, textures, and aesthetic style

**STREAMING OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
- Stream rankings one by one, starting with rank 1 (highest similarity score)
- Output each ranking immediately as you determine it
- Stop after outputting the top 10 rankings (or fewer if less than 10 thumbnails provided)
- Format each ranking as a complete JSON object on its own line
- Do not include any other text, explanations, or formatting

**JSON FORMAT**
Each ranking must be output as a single line JSON object in this exact format:
{"id": "thumbnail_id", "similarityScore": 85, "rank": 1}

**RANKING GUIDELINES**

1. **Focus on the Named Product**: Only compare thumbnails to the "[PRODUCT_NAME]" specifically mentioned, not other items in the original image

2. **Visual Similarity Priority**: Prioritize products that look most similar to the target product in the original image

3. **Scoring Scale**:
   - 90-100: Nearly identical or extremely similar
   - 80-89: Very similar with minor differences
   - 70-79: Similar with some noticeable differences
   - 60-69: Moderately similar
   - 50-59: Somewhat similar
   - Below 50: Low similarity

4. **Ranking Order**: Always rank from highest to lowest similarity score (rank 1 = highest score)

5. **Consistency**: Ensure ranking numbers are sequential (1, 2, 3, etc.) and similarity scores reflect the ranking order

**IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS**
- Output ONLY the JSON ranking objects, one per line
- No additional text, explanations, or commentary
- Stop immediately after 10 rankings
- Each JSON object must be complete and valid
- Thumbnail IDs must exactly match the provided thumbnail identifiers

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT**
{"id": "thumb_001", "similarityScore": 92, "rank": 1}
{"id": "thumb_015", "similarityScore": 87, "rank": 2}
{"id": "thumb_008", "similarityScore": 81, "rank": 3}
{"id": "thumb_023", "similarityScore": 76, "rank": 4}
{"id": "thumb_012", "similarityScore": 71, "rank": 5}

Begin ranking now. Focus on "[PRODUCT_NAME]" in the original image and compare against all provided thumbnails.
