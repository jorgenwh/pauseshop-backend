Analyze this image and identify all visible products within the video frame of the screenshot.

**PRODUCT ORDERING (VISUAL IMPORTANCE)**
Return products in the following order of visual importance:
1.  PRIMARY FOCUS: Products that are centrally located, in sharp focus, well-lit, and clearly the main subject.
2.  SECONDARY FOCUS: Products that are prominent but slightly off-center or in mid-ground.
3.  BACKGROUND/PERIPHERAL: Products that are in background, partially obscured, or less prominent.

The JSON array order MUST reflect this visual importance: primary products first, then secondary, then background. 
The first products in your JSON array should be the most visually prominent and important items.
Contextually related items must appear consecutively in the output array (e.g., items worn by same person, on same desk, or in same set).

**PRODUCT IDENTIFICATION RULES**
- Each distinct clothing item or accessory must be identified as a SEPARATE product.
    - Examples:
        - A blazer and shirt worn together = TWO separate products
        - A suit jacket and pants = TWO separate products
        - A dress and shoes = TWO separate products
        - A watch and bracelet = TWO separate products
- DO NOT split single items with multiple colors/patterns into separate products. Treat them as ONE product.
    - Examples:
        - A single tank top with green accents = ONE product
        - A single striped shirt = ONE product
        - A single color-blocked dress = ONE product
- If multiple identical products are visible (e.g., three people wearing the same uniform), list the product only once.

**REQUIRED PRODUCT ATTRIBUTES**
For each product, provide the following:
1.  Product name/description (include color if visible)
2.  Icon Category (MUST be one of the following: [LIST_OF_CATEGORIES_HERE])
3.  Category (MUST be one of the broad categories: 'clothing', 'electronics', 'furniture', 'accessories', 'footwear', 'home_decor', 'books_media', 'sports_fitness', 'beauty_personal_care', 'kitchen_dining', 'other')
3.  Brand (if visible/identifiable)
4.  Primary color (the main/dominant color of the item)
5.  Secondary colors (if applicable)
6.  Key identifying features (style, material, pattern, etc.)
7.  Target gender/demographic (men, women, unisex, boy, girl)
8.  Optimized search terms for finding this product online

**JSON OUTPUT FORMAT**
Format your response as a JSON array of objects with this structure:
{
    "products": [
        {
            "name": "product name with color",
            "iconCategory": "icon category", "Must be one of the allowed icon categories",
            "category": "broad category", "Must be one of the broad categories"
            "brand": "brand name or unknown",
            "primaryColor": "main color",
            "secondaryColors": ["color1", "color2"],
            "features": ["style", "material", "pattern"],
            "targetGender": "men" | "women" | "unisex" | "boy" | "girl",
            "searchTerms": "optimized search terms for finding this product"
        }
    ]
}

**DETAILED GUIDELINES FOR ATTRIBUTES**
- **Product Name:** Max 25 characters. Do not be too descriptive. Only include gender in the product name
        if there are multiple similar products (e.g., "t-shirt") where one is clearly for men and another for women,
        to differentiate them (e.g., "men's t-shirt", "women's t-shirt"). If only one gender-specific product is found,
        do not include gender in the name.
- **Colors:**
    - Always identify and include the primary color of items.
    - Be specific with colors (e.g., "navy blue" not just "blue", "forest green" not just "green").
    - Include ALL visible colors in the search terms for multi-colored items.
- **Target Gender:**
    - For clothing: If you see a man wearing clothing, identify it as "men's" clothing.
    - For clothing: If you see a woman wearing clothing, identify it as "women's" clothing.
    - For clothing: If you see a child wearing clothing, identify it as "children's" clothing.
    - Only mark as "unisex" if the item is truly gender-neutral.
- **Search Terms:**
    - Follow this pattern: "[gender] [colors] [product type] [material/style]".
    - Examples: "men's navy blue cotton shorts", "women's black tank top with green accents", "red wireless headphones".
    - **Product Specificity for Search Terms:**
        - For items where a generic description is useful for consumer search
            (e.g., clothing, general accessories), provide search terms even if the exact brand or model is unknown
            (e.g., "green sweatshirt", "black backpack").
        - For items where a generic description is *not* useful for consumer search and requires high specificity for a meaningful result
            (e.g., specific electronics like laptops, beverages like wine bottles), do your best to determine the exact product type, brand,
            or model. Only provide search terms if you are highly confident in this specific identification. If confidence is low,
            omit search terms or provide only very broad, non-specific terms
            (e.g., "laptop" instead of "black laptop", or no search terms for a generic "green bottle").
