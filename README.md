# PauseShop üõí

Ever paused Netflix and thought "I NEED that lamp"? We got you covered! üõãÔ∏è‚ú®

PauseShop is a Chrome extension that turns your streaming addiction into a shopping opportunity. Pause any video, and we'll magically find those products on Amazon for you (or hopefully something similar).

## How it works ü™Ñ

1. **Pause** your show (we know you were going to anyway)
2. **Screenshot** gets taken automatically üì∏
3. **AI** figures out what stuff is in the scene ü§ñ
4. **Amazon** search results appear like magic ‚ú®
5. **Shop** till you drop (or until you resume the show)

## What it supports üì∫

- Netflix
- YouTube
- ~~Hulu~~
- ~~Prime Video~~
- ~~Disney+~~
- ~~HBO Max~~

Basically everywhere you procrastinate.

_Disclaimer: We are not responsible for your impulse purchases or explaining to your partner why you bought a $200 throw pillow because you saw it in Bridgerton._

## Setup Instructions üöÄ

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 18.0.0
- **npm** >= 9.0.0
- **Chrome browser** (for loading the extension)

### 1. Install Dependencies

Clone the repository and install all dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jorgenwh/pauseshop
cd pauseshop
npm install
```

This will install dependencies for both the extension and server workspaces.

### 2. Environment Configuration

#### Server Environment Setup

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp server/.env.example server/.env
   ```

2. Edit `server/.env` and configure Gemini (required for image analysis):

   ```env
   ANALYSIS_PROVIDER=gemini
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20
   ```

   **Getting a Gemini API Key:**
   1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
   2. Sign in with your Google account
   3. Click "Create API Key"
   4. Copy the generated key and paste it in your `.env` file

3. Optionally configure the server port (default is 3000):
   ```env
   PORT=3000
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

### 3. Build the Extension

Build the Chrome extension for production:

```bash
npm run build:extension
```

Or for development with file watching:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This creates a `dist` folder in the `extension` directory with all the built files.

### 4. Build and Run the Server

#### Build the Server

```bash
npm run build:server
```

#### Run the Server

For development (with auto-restart):
```bash
npm run dev:server
```

For production:
```bash
npm run start --workspace=server
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured PORT).

### 5. Load the Extension in Chrome

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top right)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `extension/dist` folder from your project directory
5. The PauseShop extension should now appear in your extensions list

### 6. Verify Setup

1. Make sure the server is running (`npm run dev:server`)
2. Open a supported video site (Netflix, YouTube)
3. Play a video and pause it
4. The PauseShop sidebar should appear with product suggestions

## Troubleshooting üîß

### Extension Not Loading
- Make sure you built the extension (`npm run build:extension`)
- Check that the `extension/dist` folder exists and contains files
- Verify Developer mode is enabled in Chrome extensions

### Server Connection Issues
- Ensure the server is running on the correct port
- Check your `.env` file configuration
- Verify your Gemini API key is valid and has proper permissions

### Image Analysis Not Working
- Check that your `ANALYSIS_PROVIDER=gemini` in the `.env` file
- Verify your Gemini API key is correct and active
- Make sure you have sufficient API quota remaining

### Build Errors
- Make sure you have the correct Node.js and npm versions
- Try deleting `node_modules` and running `npm install` again
- Check for any TypeScript compilation errors
